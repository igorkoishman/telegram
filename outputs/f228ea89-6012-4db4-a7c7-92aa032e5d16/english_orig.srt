1
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:07,480
I woke up this morning to a war going on in Gaza in Southern Israel and I want to give

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,380
this conflict background before I head into work.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,019
I'm in Spartanburg, South Carolina right now on a consulting job but I have a few minutes

4
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:21,120
for I have to be on site and keep in mind that all I have is a laptop right now and a lot

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,519
of my tools and large monitors aren't with me.

6
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,219
The tough thing is that I have a number of Israeli viewers and I also have a number of

7
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,600
Palestinian viewers who by the way think it's hilarious when I speak Arabic with my Egyptian accent.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,140
What I'd really like is for everybody just kind of go home and live in peace but that doesn't

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,060
seem to be in the cards right now.

10
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,640
So here's what I think is going on and then I want to get into some of the background on the

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,460
Israel, Palestinian conflict.

12
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,380
On October 7th, Palestinian forces launched thousands of rockets into Israel.

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,420
They also conducted raids into Southern Israel over land, sea and believe you're not air.

14
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,400
That's right, Palestinian forces launched uh, paragliders into Israel.

15
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,560
So that's certainly one way of doing infiltration.

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,620
Now from what I understand these Palestinian forces are focused on the city of Ash-Klaun

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,819
where they have gone door-to-door attacking and in some cases kidnapping civilians.

18
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:19,739
So here's a background.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,659
Jews, Arabs, and Christians, live together and mostly peaceful coexistence in Palestine for

20
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,920
hundreds of years under the rule of the Ottoman Turks.

21
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,700
World War I broke out in 1914.

22
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,760
The Turks were on Germany's side. Britain decided to open up a southern front by capturing the

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,340
cyanide peninsula and taking Palestine from the Turks.

24
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,840
Now there is no more dangerous predator in the desert than a better one and is rifle.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,859
So Britain recruited Arab leaders to their side to fight against the Turks by promise and

26
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,359
them Palestine when they won.

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,439
Britain also recruited several petions made up of local Jews living in Palestine with the promise

28
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,140
that if they helped defeat the Turks, the Jews would get their own homeland.

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,240
This was very appealing to a Jewish movement called Zionism, which basically advocated for a Jewish

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,240
homeland. Zion, by the way, is the name for a hill in Jerusalem and sometimes it's used

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,139
colloquially in the Bible for Jerusalem. So Britain essentially promised the same piece of land

32
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:32,280
to the Arabs and the Jews and while this may seem crazy and hindsight, it raised the troops that

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Britain needed to open up the southern front against Turkey.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,219
Britain eventually received a mandate from the League of Nations to administer Palestine.

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,340
In 1947 the United Nations proposed a partition plan for Palestine which recommended the establishment

36
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:54,379
of separate Jewish and Arab states with Jerusalem under international administration.

37
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,319
This plan was accepted by Jewish leadership but it was rejected by the Arab states and Palestinian

38
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,780
Arab leaders. The partition plan was never fully implemented. Israel declared independence

39
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:16,560
in May of 1948, neighbouring Arab states invaded Israel immediately, leading to the 1948 Arab

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,620
Israeli war. Israel calls it the war of independence. The Arabs call it Anakhba, the catastrophe.

41
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,560
Even though Israel was poorly equipped and trained, they somehow won against five nations,

42
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:39,419
Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Jewish militias then expelled over 700,000 Palestinians

43
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,099
from their homes. The state of Israel grew beyond the original borders set by the United Nations.

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,699
Many Palestinians ended up in a thin strip of land called Gaza or this landlocked area called

45
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:58,780
West Bank or Lebanon. And before you think about how barbaric it was for Israel to eject these people,

46
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:06,060
I want you to look at your neighbor. The only reason that you are alive today is thousands of

47
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,860
years ago someone from your tribe wiped out someone from a competing tribe. You have the luxury

48
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,839
of being able to clutch your pearls at Israel's actions because your tribe won the war before social

49
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,939
media. I mean I'm sure everybody in Florida feels horrible about what Andrew Jackson did to the

50
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,379
seminal nation but then they're like, you know, it is nice we don't have to shovel snow.

51
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,680
So that's the root of the conflict. You have a country that just wants to write to exist,

52
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,579
putting itself against a nation of refugees that don't feel like they got what they were promised.

53
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:48,120
And that's the general background. What's going on right now is that Israel is activating its

54
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,379
service and life is going to get pretty hard for the Palestinians in the next few days. I strongly

55
00:04:53,379 --> 00:05:00,860
suggest that you join my Substack, Ryan MacBeth.substack.com. It's free because I'm probably not going

56
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,980
to be able to show you sort of kind of footage on YouTube and that's really going to make it hard

57
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,199
for me to perform analysis. I got to get to my consulting gig, I'll be monitoring the situation

58
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,459
as best I can. Thank you guys for watching.
